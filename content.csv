pierre	14,091	1880	Center	Suburban	$6,209 less	Pierre	A large building located in Pierre	History	Founded in 1880 on the east bank of the Missouri River, Pierre emerged as a community opposite Fort Pierre-a former trading post. When South Dakota gained statehood on November 2, 1889, Pierre was designated as the state capital. Despite challenges from Huron, Pierre's strategic centrality within the state secured its position.	Pierre's growth was influenced by the Rapid City, Pierre and Eastern Railroad, enhancing regional market access and passenger transportation. However, in the post-World War II era, federally subsidized highways led to relative isolation. Notably, Pierre is among the few state capitals not served by the Interstate Highway System. Over time, Pierre would slowly develope many industrial parks supported by the local goverment's use of fair land agreement which incentivised proper land ownership for tax benefits. As more businesses flocked to the area, so did the town's overall population. Still, other key cities in the state outpaced this growth.	Things to do	Pierre holds a unique position in South Dakota's history. Established in 1880 along the Missouri River, it became the state capital upon South Dakota's admission to statehood. With a population of 14,091 according to the 2020 census, Pierre ranks as the second least populous state capital in the United States, following Montpelier, Vermont. Despite its modest size, Pierre plays a vital role as the seat of Hughes County and the principal city of the Pierre Micropolitan Statistical Area, encompassing both Hughes and Stanley counties.	Pierre invites visitors to explore its blend of culture, natural beauty, and historical significance. Whether you're interested in the State Capitol, the South Dakota Cultural Heritage Center, or the serene shores of the Flaming Fountain, this city offers something for every traveler. As you wander through its streets, you'll discover a place where past and present converge, making Pierre a captivating destination in the heart of South Dakota.
sioux-falls	192,517	1856	East	Suburban	$5,114 more	Sioux Falls	The falls located in Sioux Falls	History	Sioux Falls owes its history to the ancient cascades of the Big Sioux River, formed around 14,000 years ago during the last ice age. Before European settlers arrived, a tapestry of indigenous communities-including the Ho-Chunk, Ioway, Otoe, Missouri, Omaha, Quapaw, Kansa, Osage, Arikira, Dakota, and Cheyenne called this region home. Burial mounds still dot the high bluffs near the river, remnants of an agricultural society with fortified villages. Today, Sioux Falls hosts a vibrant community, where Lakota, Dakota, and other Indigenous Americans reside alongside urban and reservation populations.	In the early 18th century, French voyagers explored the area, but it was Philander Prescott, an American of European descent, who camped overnight at the falls in December 1832. Captain James Allen's military expedition from Fort Des Moines followed in 1844. Jacob Ferris immortalized the falls in his 1856 book 'The States and Territories of the Great West.' As European settlers arrived, two groups-the Dakota Land Company of St. Paul and the Western Town Company of Dubuque, Iowa-organized in 1856 to claim the land around the falls. Their vision for a promising townsite, blessed with natural beauty and water power, led to the establishment of Sioux Falls. The settlers even erected a temporary barricade called Fort Sod in response to native tribes defending their land. Thus began the city's journey, with a population that grew from 17 men spending the first winter to nearly 40 the following year.	Things to do	Sioux Falls stands as the most populous city in South Dakota and ranks 121st in the United States. The city's population was 192,517 according to the 2020 census, with an estimated growth to 202,078 in 2022. City officials project that the population has further increased to 213,891 as of early 2024. Notably, the Sioux Falls metro area contributes over 30% of the state's total population. Chartered in 1856 along the banks of the Big Sioux River, this dynamic city nestles amid rolling hills at the convergence of interstates 29 and 90-12.	Sioux Falls boasts a rich history shaped by the cascades of the Big Sioux River, which formed around 14,000 years ago during the last ice age. Indigenous communities, including the Lakota and Dakota, inhabited the region before European settlers arrived. Today, the city offers a blend of natural beauty, cultural attractions, and urban amenities. Visitors can explore Falls Park, admire the skyline, and immerse themselves in the vibrant community that thrives at the heart of South Dakota.
rapid-city	138,268	1877	West	Suburban	$1,379 less	Rapid City	The hills that divide Rapid City in two	History	Rapid City owes its origins to the public discovery of gold in 1874 by the Black Hills Expedition, led by George Armstrong Custer. European-American miners and settlers flocked to the area, and in 1876, a group of unsuccessful miners founded the city. Originally known as Hay Camp, they promoted it as the Gateway to the Black Hills. The name eventually changed to Rapid City, inspired by the spring-fed Rapid Creek that flows through it.	Rapid City's strategic location on the edge of the Plains and Hills, along with its large river valley, made it a natural hub for railroads constructed in the late 1880s. By 1900, it had weathered boom-and-bust cycles and emerged as a vital regional trade center. In the 20th century, local entrepreneurs capitalized on the Black Hills' popularity, improved roadways, and the availability of automobiles. Tourists, including President Calvin Coolidge, flocked to the area, and iconic landmarks like Mount Rushmore began taking shape.	Things to do	Rapid City, the second most populous city in South Dakota, sits on the eastern slope of the Black Hills. Named after Rapid Creek, it boasts a population of 138,268 as of the 2020 census. Known as the Gateway to the Black Hills, this vibrant city is home to life-size bronze statues of U.S. presidents and is split by a low mountain ridge known as The Gap	Rapid City offers a rich array of attractions, including Art Alley, Dinosaur Park, the City of Presidents walking tour, Chapel in the Hills, Storybook Island, and Main Street Square. Nearby, the historic town of Deadwood beckons, while the Black Hills region boasts iconic tourist destinations like Mount Rushmore, the Crazy Horse Memorial, Custer State Park, Wind Cave National Park, Jewel Cave National Monument, and the Black Hills Institute of Geological Research Museum. To the east lies the striking Badlands National Park, a must-see for all new tourists.
